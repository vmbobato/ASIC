            <h1>ASIC - AI for satelite image classification</h1>
            
            <section class="blog-section">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> Measuring the size of land areas like cities, forests, and ice formations is challenging, 
                    especially when you need accurate data over time. Our project aims to use AI and satellite 
                    imagery to automate that process. By leveraging image recognition technology, our system 
                    can detect and classify different land types, like urban areas, forests, farmland, and ice, 
                    directly from satellite images. </p>
                <p> AI for Satellite Image Classification (ASIC) is a software project that uses deep learning to 
                    do pixel-level classification of satellite images. The main goal is to figure out what 
                    percentage of an image is covered by each land type by segmenting it and calculating the 
                    area of each class. This could be useful for a wide range of people, like city planners 
                    tracking urban growth or environmental researchers monitoring deforestation and melting 
                    ice.</p>
            </section>
        
            <section class="blog-section">
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p> Land use maps are essential for informed decision making in fields like urban planning, 
                    agriculture, and environmental science. City planners rely on up-to-date area measurements 
                    to manage infrastructure, zoning, and services. Agricultural managers need to monitor crop 
                    rotations and estimate yields. Environmental researchers track deforestation, wetlands loss, 
                    and ice melting. These people could find a fine-tuned model for their images useful.
                </p>
                <p> Traditional mapping is often done yearly, which is not fast enough. Planners need quicker 
                    updates to protect areas. Our solution is AI-powered pixel segmentation. It works on satellite 
                    images to create 7-class land masks, automating the task. Urban expansion in particular is a 
                    big reason why this kind of tool is needed. According to the United Nations, more than half of 
                    the world’s population lived in cities by 2010, and that number is expected to reach 60% by 
                    2025. As urban populations grow and densities drop, urban land area is projected to more 
                    than triple. By providing clear and accurate land type breakdowns from satellite images, 
                    ASIC can help monitor and potentially manage these changes more responsibly.

                <h2>Related Work</h2>
                <p>This is a project that has been done before, the image segmentation part at least. Where we 
                    add to it is by taking these classification models and applying them in a real AI software tool 
                    that gives users useful outputs, like the percentage of land types in a satellite image and the 
                    size of those areas in square meters</p>
                <p>
                    For training and testing, there are a few common datasets used, like DeepGlobe, EuroSat, 
                    and Sen2Land. These datasets include different types of land use and come with correct 
                    segmentation masks. We ended up using the DeepGlobe dataset, which we will talk more 
                    about later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To figure out the best way to segment the satellite images, we looked into different models 
                    and datasets that have been used in similar projects and that we thought could be useful for 
                    ours.

                <p>
                    One of the earliest and most well-known CNN models is U-Net. It uses a U-shaped 
                    architecture with skip connections to help preserve spatial details during segmentation. It is a 
                    solid baseline that works well in many cases, but it tends to struggle with thin or detailed 
                    objects and has trouble capturing the bigger picture in large images. We did not test this one 
                    though. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    DeepLabV3+ is another CNN-based model that is better at capturing features at different 
                    scales. It produces sharp segmentation edges, and we did test this one (we will talk more 
                    about that later). Some of the issues we had with it were that even though it gave pretty 
                    good segmentation, it was hard to get accurate classification of the different land areas

                <h2>Transformers</h2>
                <p>
                    We also looked at some transformer models that have recently been used for segmentation 
                    tasks, and are probably the most promising overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SegFormer is a lightweight transformer that performed really well in our tests. It strikes a 
                    nice balance between speed and accuracy, and does not need positional encoding, which 
                    makes it easier to train and more flexible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swin-Unet is another transformer-based model, built like U-Net but with a transformer 
                    backbone. We did not test this one, but it's often mentioned in related work
                </p>
                <p>
                    We did test the SAM2 model from Meta. It did not perform as well out-of-the-box for our use 
                    case. It had some success in auto mode, but not enough to rely on without more fine-tuning. 
                    We also had trouble getting it to capture everything in the image and to correctly classify the 
                    segmented areas.

            <section class="blog-section">
                <h2>Problem Set-Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to treat this task as an image segmentation problem, one where each individual pixel in a 
                    satellite image is assigned a class label corresponding to a land type. We wanted to extract more detailed 
                    information by looking at what's happening at the pixel level to give more useful meassurements for people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of existing models that perform well in general image segmentation, so we wanted to use these
                    for our project. The main idea was to leverage these powerful mdeols and fine-tune them so that they could 
                    accurately recognize and quantify land types like urban areas, forests, farmland, and bodies of water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want our software to output something interpretable and actionable. The final result should be a 
                    breakdown of the land composition in an image, showing what percentage of the image is made up of each land type. 
                    This would make the tool valuable not only for analysis but also for tracking changes over time.

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    To get started, we looked at a few image segmentation models to figure out which one would work best for our 
                    use case. The models we tested included SAM2, DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet50 encoder, and SegFormerB2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our initial plan was to find the best-performing model, fine-tune it with a dataset we found 
                    online, and then use it to output land type percentages and calculate the areas in square 
                    meters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We landed on the SegFormerB2, because of it's pixel classification capabilities and overall precision. We tried to combine SAM2
                    and DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet50 encoder, where we first segmented an image and then labeled the segmented areas, but the SegFormerB2
                    overall performed better. Next step was to fine-tune it using our satellite image dataset. We adapted the training process 
                    to better fit the kind of images we were dealing with and the specific land-type labels we wanted the model to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we selected the model, we fine-tuned it using our satellite image dataset. We adapted 
                    the training process to fit the types of images we were working with and the specific 
                    land-type labels we wanted the model to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After training, we used the model to segment new satellite images. From the segmentation 
                    maps, we calculated what percentage of the image each land type covered and from that, 
                    estimated the actual area in square meters. This gave us exactly the kind of useful output we 
                    were aiming for.

            <section class="blog-section">
                <h2>Dataset</h2>
                <p>
                    For training and evaluation, we used the DeepGlobe 2018 dataset. It's a dataset with 803 samples, 
                    each made up of a satellite image, a ground truth segmentation map, and a mask. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dataset covers 7 land-type classes, each one represented by a different color in the mask:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[0] Urban Land       - Cyan (0, 255, 255)</li>
                    <li>[1] Agriculture Land - Yellow (255, 255, 0)</li>
                    <li>[2] Rangeland        - Magenta (255, 0, 255)</li>
                    <li>[3] Forest Land      - Green (0, 255, 0)</li>
                    <li>[4] Water            - Blue (0, 0, 255)</li>
                    <li>[5] Barren Land      - White (255, 255, 255)</li>
                    <li>[6] Unknown          - Black (0, 0, 0)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These color-coded masks made it easier to visualize what the model was learning and to evaluate how well it was doing during training. 
                    To add some visual verification other than the pixel accuracy, IOU-values and other evaluation metrics.

            <section class="blog-section">
                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up using SegFormer B2 as our base model. It is a transformer-based architecture 
                    that comes pretrained on the ADE20K dataset, and it gave us the best results overall, 
                    especially when it came to pixel-level accuracy. We trained it on images sized 512×512, with 
                    a batch size of 4. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the data work for training, we built a pipeline that converted the RGB segmentation 
                    masks into class labels the model could actually learn from. On top of that, we added some 
                    basic data augmentations like flipping, rotating, color jitter, and gaussian blur. This was to 
                    help the model generalize better and not just memorize the training set. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the loss function, we did not rely on just one type. Instead, we combined Cross Entropy, 
                    Dice Loss, and Focal Loss, because each one helps in a different way. Cross Entropy 
                    handles general classification, Dice is good for imbalanced data, and Focal puts more focus 
                    on the hard-to-classify pixels, which made the loss function look like this:
                </p>
                <p><code>Loss = 0.33 * Dice + 0.33 * CrossEntropy + 0.34 * Focal</code></p>
                <p>
                    When training, we kept things pretty straightforward. We did some early stopping and 
                    lowered the learning rate if the model did not improve after 3 epochs. To evaluate how well 
                    things were going, we looked at metrics like pixel accuracy, IoU for each class, mean IoU, 
                    and class coverage. We saved the model checkpoint that had the highest mean IoU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that we output the image and calculate the percentage of each land type in the image 
                    using a simple coverage function and then how much this would correspond to in square 
                    meters if the user selected this function.
                </p>

            <section class="blog-section">
                <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
                <p>
                    We evaluated the model using both visual outputs and metrics like pixel accuracy, IoU, mean 
                    IoU, and class coverage. Overall, the model did okay, but the results were not amazing. We 
                    had a bit of an imbalanced dataset too. With some land types like agriculture and rangeland 
                    showed up in most of the images, so the model learned those better. Other classes like 
                    water, forest, and urban areas were harder for it to get right, since they appeared less often
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see in the IoU-per-class graph that agriculture and rangeland performed the best, 
                    while forest and water stayed pretty low. Urban and barren land were somewhere in between 
                    but not super consistent. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pixel accuracy went above 70%, which is decent, but accuracy could definitely be 
                    improved. The mean IoU ended up hovering around 25–26%. We also built some visual 
                    tools to actually look at the model outputs. These helped us confirm that large, clearly 
                    defined areas were segmented well, but smaller or mixed regions were still tricky for the 
                    model.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    ASIC shows that modern image segmentation models can be adapted to work pretty well 
                    with satellite images. Our software can break down an image into land types and give useful 
                    stats like percentage coverage and area in square meters. That alone could be helpful for 
                    people working with things like urban planning or environmental monitoring.

                    That said, there is still a lot of room to improve. One big challenge is that satellite images 
                    often have blurry or overlapping land types, and there are not always clear boundaries 
                    between classes. This makes it harder for the model to be super accurate, especially when 
                    some classes appear way more than others in the dataset.

                    Our current model works well in the web app and gives decent results. But if this were to be 
                    used professionally, we would need to boost the IoU and pixel accuracy for all classes
